# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4), but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

# Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)


## Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

> Explanation given for methods used to extract HOG features, including which color space was chosen, which HOG parameters (orientations, pixels_per_cell, cells_per_block), and why.
